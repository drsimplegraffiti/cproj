// Create a File

// The fopen() function can not only open a file but also can create a file if
// it does not exist already. For that, we have to use the modes that allow the
// creation of a file if not found such as w, w+, wb, wb+, a, a+, ab, and ab+.

  // with access mode "w"

  // checking if the file is created
  if (fptr == NULL)
